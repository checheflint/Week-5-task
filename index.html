        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML that is used for structure and CSS that is used for styling. It is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content.  It allows developers to build features such as interactive forms, animations, real-time updates, and more.</p>

    <h3>1. Creating Interactive Web Pages</h3>
    <p>
        With Javascript, websites can respond to user actions, making them more engaging. It powers features like dropdown menus, image sliders, modals, and interactive forms. For example, it can show or hide content, validate inputs, or trigger animations when a user clicks a button.
    </p><br>

    <h3>2. Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model)</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript can modify the structure, content, and styling of a web page in real time through the DOM. Developers can add, remove, or update elements and styles dynamically, such as highlighting a menu item or inserting new content without reloading the page.
    </p><br>

    <h3>3. Handling Events</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript detects and responds to user actions like clicks, typing, scrolling, or resizing. It allows specific actions to be triggered when these events occur, such as submitting a form, showing a message, or loading additional content.
    </p><br>

    <h3>4. Communicating with Servers</h3>
    <p>
        Using technologies like AJAX and the Fetch API, JavaScript exchanges data with servers without reloading the page. This supports real-time updates and smooth user experiences, such as loading new search results or submitting forms in the background.
